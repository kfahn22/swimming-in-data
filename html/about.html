									 <p>Hi, I'm Kathy and this website is about how we as a society are collecting and processing increasingly greater
										 amounts of data--or information--about every aspect of our lives.</p>
										 <br>
								 </div>
						</div>
						<div class="about-site" id="info">
									<p>"Perfect information" (a state of the world in which people can easily and accurately
										obtain information) is essential for a well functioning market economy.</p>
										<p>In some ways, the development of the web has given us an unprecedented ability to access information.
										The proliferation of websites dedicated to online learning for youth, such as <a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/">Khan Academy</a>, and the multitude of sites
										where you are able to learn from world-class professors--moocs such as Edx and  Coursera,
										free online courses provided by University of Michigan's <a href="-chuck.com">Dr. Chuck</a>, and youtube channels, such as John
										Hopkin's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/rogerpeng">Roger Peng</a> teaching R, NYU's  Daniel Siffman teaching Processing at his channel
										<a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvjgXvBlbQiydffZU7m1_aw">The Coding Train</a>, as well as Chris Ching teaching Swift at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/codewithchris">CodeWithChris</a>
										--are just a few examples that I have personally used.</p>
										<p>Search engines such as Google allow us to find and compare products and services easily.  I am no longer surprised when I imagine
											 a new product idea, and can invariably I can find the product already for sale on the web.</p>
											<p>  All of this amazing technology comes with a cost. The price is the marketing data that is being collected <em>about us</em>. I am going to explore how this information
										is currently being collected and used--for good or ill--and how you can make informed decisions based on the available data.</p>

								<h2>Bio</h2>

								<p> I have an advanced degree in economics with a specialization in econometrics.


									<!--I am married and have two lovely adult daughters.  When the oldest was born, I left the workforce to
									be a full-time mom. While I missed being an economist, it was truely a joy to be able
									 to raise my daughters full time.  It provided the opportunity to be the home-room mom, and lead my daughter's girl scout troop.  I also swam
									 on a Master's swim team for many years. </p>

									 I am currently serve on the board of a local community center, where I also volunteer as a tutor.  Additionally, I help produce the Livestream at
									 my local church, where I also help organize the quarterly food drive.   My hobbies include swimming, hiking, sewing, gardening, and baking.-->

									 During the pandemic I started taking online courses to keep myself busy,
									 focussing pirmarily on updating my knowledge of data processing and finance.  In the process, I rediscovered my love of data analysis.
									  I am now (somewhat) familiar with python, R, SQL, php, git, javascript, cpanel, processing, and basic web design. I am not an expert in any of these
									 languages, but I continue to learn. I am currently trying my learn C and Swift.
