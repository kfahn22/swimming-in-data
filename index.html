				<h2>Real World Constraints on Data Collection</h2>
				<p>My father is a physicist. He is obviously very bright, and this is possibly why he always insisted on
					giving a post-movie analysis
					regarding the believability of movie plots. I am envisioning his reaction to a movie entitled
					"Vaccine," in which a sinister government
					collects and stores information about their citizens <em> by administering a vaccine during a
						pandemic.</em>
					He would spend the hour after we had seen the movie describing in great detail just how ludicrous
					the plot was: (1) this technology does not
					exist, (2) even if it did--where is all this data going to be stored, and (3) having a ton of data
					on hundreds of millions of people isn't very useful unless you have the
					man-power to analyze it. I, on the other hand, am willing to suspend my disbelief to enjoy a good
					movie. But I am quite frankly baffled at the number of people who apparently
					accept as truth the notion that the COVID vaccine (or any other vaccine for that matter) is capable
					of transmitting biometric
					data to wifi towers. I did a little bit of Googling to try to figure out where this idea came from,
					and this is what I learned.
					One of the challenges of vaccinating people in poorer countries is that most do not have the ability
					to keep a good record of the
					vaccines that have been administered. Researchers at MIT are trying to address this critical issue
					by working on a special invisible dye that
					could be delivered along with a vaccine. This dye would contain nanocrystals that emit near-infrared
					light that would create something
					akin to a very tiny QR code tatoo that could be detected by a specially equipped smartphone. So
					let's review. There <em>are</em> researchers who are
					trying to create a way to use a vaccine's ingredients to store data, but the information they want
					to store is <em>about the delivery of the vaccine itself</em>,
					which is critical information when it is part of a multi-dose regimen. It is important to note that
					the research is still in the experimental stage at this point
					and has not has not been tested on humans.
					(On a side note, this research was partially funded by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, which
					has a history
					of funding research on vaccines to prevent illnesse--such as malari--in poorer countries.) You can
					read more about
					the MIT research <a class="link"

				<h2>Two Truths and a Lie</h2>
				<blockquote style="margin-left: 25%; margin-right: 25%; text-align: center; color:#0a1a32;">"There are
					lies, damn lies, and statistics" </blockquote>


				<p>This phrase, which is often attributed to Mark Twain, was a favorite of my Uncle Richard.
					As someone with extensive training in statistics and econometrics--I have also learned that while
					data analysis is
					extremely useful--it is important to be aware of potential biases and weaknesses in the analysis.
					Let me give you one very simple example. NOAA has a dataset on the economic and human impacts of
					weather events.
					I have written three statements below. Can you spot the lie?</p>

				<div id="statements">
					<p>Statement 1: Tornados kill more people than any other weather event.</p>
					<p>Statement 2: Tsunamies are a big danger in the US Midwest.</p>
					<p>Statement 3: Extreme heat kill more people than any other weather event.</p>
				</div>
				<br>

				<div>
					<p><span id="text"> Which would did you get was incorrect. I bet you choose statement 2, but that is
							not correct.
							Statement 1 is the one that is incorrect. While the database started in 1950, until 1996
							tornados, thunderstorms, wind and hail were the only events
							in the database. If you were to run a query on the data to find out the most deadly type of
							weather
							event, you would conclude that tornadoes are the most deadly. However, if you filter the
							data to include only those years that
							include the entire group of weather events, you would find that extreme heat causes the most
							deaths. Extreme head is the number one
							killer, which we was in evidence this past year. Although the midwest doesn't seem like it
							would have tsunamis, the Great Lakes
							have a common type of tsunami called a "meteotsunamis", which is kind of like bath water
							sloshing around it a bathtub.</span></p>

				<p>"Perfect information" (a state of the world in which people can easily and accurately

				<p>In some ways, the development of the web has given us an unprecedented ability to access information.
					The proliferation of websites dedicated to online learning for youth, such as <a class="link"
						href="https://www.khanacademy.org/">Khan Academy</a>, and the multitude of sites
					where you are able to learn from world-class professors--moocs such as Edx and Coursera,

					--are just a few examples that I have personally used.</p>
				<p>Search engines such as Google allow us to find and compare products and services easily. I am no
					longer surprised when I imagine
					a new product idea, and can invariably I can find the product already for sale on the web.</p>
				<p> All of this amazing technology comes with a cost. The price is the marketing data that is being
					collected <em>about us</em>. I am going to explore how this information
					is currently being collected and used--for good or ill--and how you can make informed decisions
					based on the available data.</p>
